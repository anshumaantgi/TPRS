Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science,"Mathematical thinking is crucial in all areas of computer science: algorithms, bioinformatics, computer graphics, data science, machine learning, etc. In this course, we will learn the most important tools used in discrete mathematics: induction, recursion, logic, invariants, examples, optimality. We will use these tools to answer typical programming questions like: How can we be certain a solution exists? Am I sure my program computes the optimal answer? Do each of these objects meet the given requirements?",Computer Science,Algorithms,Course,"Mathematical Induction,Proof Theory,Discrete Mathematics,Mathematical Logic,"
