        "Short Intro": "Roughly half of the world\u2019s population is already online and so setting yourself apart from the crowd is more important than ever before.  One of the best ways to do that is by creating your own ePortfolio.  An ePortfolio is a site that showcases or shows your background, your resume, and samples of your work.  In this course, you will learn step by step how to build the site and you\u2019ll learn the grammar, vocabulary and writing skills needed to create it.  You will learn how to apply information from your ePortfolio to other online tools like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube in order to network with others so that you get a job or connect with other professionals.  For each step in that process, you will listen to lectures, take comprehension quizzes, and learn how to use English appropriately to each part of your site.  You will also complete self and peer assessments and gain the needed skills to make your ePortfolio a reality and establish yourself online.",
