        "Short Intro": "In this course, creative nonfiction writers will explore traditional storytelling methods, especially those which overlap between fiction and memoir. By looking at examples from a wide range of genres, including film, song, painting\u2014even the theme music for Jaws!\u2014we\u2019ll practice exercising the creative muscle that sees ourselves as characters and the experiences we\u2019ve had as tales. We\u2019ll focus on critical elements, like how to begin a story, what makes for worthy content, the essential use of detail, the strengths and limits of dialogue, the power of the white space. The ultimate goal is for us to become aware of an \u201caudience\u201d when we write, so that the documentation of our lives will begin to resemble a \u201cperformance\u201d crafted onto paper rather than a private entry in a journal.",
