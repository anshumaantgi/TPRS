In this course, you will learn what some additional skills that medical providers do to keep babies healthy.  The Newborn Assessment Course will walk you through the physical examination from head to toe.  You are going to learn that this is so much we can discover just by looking at a baby.  And yes, we will be listening too, and discussing how medical equipment, such as a stethoscope or a pulse oximeter, can help in your exam.  You will begin to be able to distinguish some normal findings from some abnormal findings.  ",
