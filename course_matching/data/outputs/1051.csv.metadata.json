        "Short Intro": "In this course you will learn and practice several techniques for user interface evaluation.  First we start with techniques that can be applied alone or in a design team, including action analysis, walkthroughs, and heuristic evaluation.  Then we move on to user testing, including learning from a series of usability tests carried out in a real usability lab, and techniques to carry out your own tests even without a lab.  Finally, we wrap up the discussion of evaluation--and of UI Design in the specialization as a whole--by looking at the question of how to set and measure usability goals, and in turn, when a design is usable enough to release it.",
