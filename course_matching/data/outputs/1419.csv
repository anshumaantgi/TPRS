Capstone: Your Story,"Everything comes together in the Capstone.  You will draft a complete story, narrative essay, or memoir of 8–15 pages.  With the advice of your peer readers, you will revise, rewrite, and complete it. The skills you’ve learned of plotting, setting, physical description, characterization, and stylistic clarity and innovation will culminate in an original work of art all your own.  We’ll discuss the steps that professional writers take to bring their work into the public world.  Along the way you’ll learn the patient habits of revision that make up the writer’s life.",Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Course,
