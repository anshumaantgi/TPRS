You will have several challenges to practice your skills throughout the course. The course objectives include how to identify objects in JavaScript; create new objects and populate them with data; manipulate objects by adding, modifying and deleting data in objects; manipulate the DOM based on the data in objects; identify and articulate how multiple functions work together to create a more complex program; and identify processes for breaking larger programs into smaller, more manageable pieces.",Computer Science,Mobile and Web Development,Course,
