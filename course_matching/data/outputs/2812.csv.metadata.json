        "Short Intro": "In the final Capstone Project, you will apply the skills you learned by observing teachers at work (a total of six hours of observation).  You will build on the concepts learned from the previous courses to analyze the lessons.  You will also submit your teaching philosophy, a five-day lesson plan, and a teaching tip. You will deliver a portion of your lesson, submitting a 6-10 minute video for peer review.  If you have completed Teach English Now! Part 1 and Teach English Now! Part 2, you will submit your work for expert review to receive your ASU 150-hour TESOL Certificate from ASU, in addition to your Coursera certificates.",
