Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop Pipelines,"In the third course of the Practical Data Science Specialization, you will learn a series of performance-improvement and cost-reduction techniques to automatically tune model accuracy, compare prediction performance, and generate new training data with human intelligence.  After tuning your text classifier using Amazon SageMaker Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT), you will deploy two model candidates into an A/B test to compare their real-time prediction performance and automatically scale the winning model using Amazon SageMaker Hosting. Lastly, you will set up a human-in-the-loop pipeline to fix misclassified predictions and generate new training data using Amazon Augmented AI and Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.",Data Science,Machine Learning,Course,"Human-in-the-Loop Pipelines,Distributed Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning,Cost Savings and Performance Improvements,A/B Testing and Model Deployment,Data Labeling at Scale,"
