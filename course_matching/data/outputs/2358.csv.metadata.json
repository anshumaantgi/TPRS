        "Short Intro": "This course covers both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Vector Calculus. During the first week, students will learn about scalar and vector fields. In the second week, they will differentiate fields. The third week focuses on multidimensional integration and curvilinear coordinate systems. Line and surface integrals are covered in the fourth week, while the fifth week explores the fundamental theorems of vector calculus, including the gradient theorem, the divergence theorem, and Stokes' theorem. These theorems are essential for subjects in engineering such as Electromagnetism and Fluid Mechanics.",
