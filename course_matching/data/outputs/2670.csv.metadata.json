        "Short Intro": "In Microsoft Azure, the Computer Vision cognitive service uses pre-trained models to analyze images, enabling software developers to easily build applications\"see\" the world and make sense of it. This ability to process images is the key to creating software that can emulate human visual perception. In this course, you'll explore some of these capabilities as you learn how to use the Computer Vision service to analyze images.",
