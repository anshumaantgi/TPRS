        "Short Intro": "This course explains how to analyze circuits that have direct current (DC) current or voltage sources.  A DC source is one that is constant.  Circuits with resistors, capacitors, and inductors are covered, both analytically and experimentally. Some practical applications in sensors are demonstrated.",
