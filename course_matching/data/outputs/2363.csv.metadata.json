        "Short Intro": "In this course we will examine the incredible variety of life that inhabits this planet including microorganisms, plants, and animals. For each of the major groups we\u2019ll learn about their characteristics, functions, and how they came into existence as well as some of the roles they play in the natural world, and how they\u2019re relevant to people. We\u2019ll also take a close look at us humans and consider what we know about our origins and what might become of us in the future.",
