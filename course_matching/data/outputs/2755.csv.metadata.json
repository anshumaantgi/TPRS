        "Short Intro": "This course is all about matrices, and concisely covers the linear algebra that an engineer should know.   The mathematics in this course is presented at the level of an advanced high school student, but it is recommended that students take this course after completing a university-level single variable calculus course.  There are no derivatives or integrals involved, but students are expected to have a basic level of mathematical maturity.  Despite this, anyone interested in learning the basics of matrix algebra is welcome to join.",
