        "Short Intro": "Through a series of engaging metaphors and stories, prospective and current EFL/ESL teachers will identify, summarize, and evaluate 7 basic language learning paradigms.  Learners will be presented information on such foundational principles as motivation, risk taking, two different modes of learning, and balancing the teacher profession.  Learners are also given an understanding of basic techniques founded on those principles, such as teacher talk, looking \u201cridiculous\u201d in order to lower the affective filter, and networking.   With these foundational principles in mind, ESL/EFL teachers will scrutinize common assumptions about language learning by comparing how they stack up to research-based core principles.",
