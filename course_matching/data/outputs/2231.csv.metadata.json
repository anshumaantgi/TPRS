        "Short Intro": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is the most widely used technique for investigating the living, functioning human brain as people perform tasks and experience mental states. It is a convergence point for multidisciplinary work from many disciplines. Psychologists, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, neuroscientists, medical researchers, behavioral scientists, engineers, public health researchers, biologists, and others are coming together to advance our understanding of the human mind and brain.  This course covers the analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.  It is a continuation of the course \u201cPrinciples of fMRI, Part 1\u201d.",
