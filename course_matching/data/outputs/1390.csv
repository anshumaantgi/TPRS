Probability Theory: Foundation for Data Science,"Understand the foundations of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science.  We’ll learn what it means to calculate a probability, independent and dependent outcomes, and conditional events.  We’ll study discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection.  We’ll end the course with Gaussian (normal) random variables and the Central Limit Theorem and understand its fundamental importance for all of statistics and data science.",Data Science,Probability and Statistics,Course,"Probability,central limit theorem,continuous random variables,Bayes' Theorem,discrete random variables,"
