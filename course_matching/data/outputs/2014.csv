Creative Writing: The Craft of Setting and Description,"In this course aspiring writers will be introduced to the techniques that masters of fiction use to ground a story in a concrete world.  From the most realist settings to the most fantastical, writers will learn how to describe the physical world in sharp, sensory detail.  We will also learn how to build credibility through research, and to use creative meditation exercises to deepen our own understanding of our story worlds, so that our readers can see all that we imagine.",Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Course,
