        "Short Intro": "Welcome to the final course of lectures in your quest to master EMT basics. In this course, we will cover some of the highest-stress patient populations: pregnant patients and kids, also known as pediatrics. To wrap up your EMT knowledge we will end this course with information about hazmat situations, extricating patients from tight spots and finally how you write a note about your patient care.  You will learn to ensure it communicates what your assessment of the patient was, what interventions you performed and why you did them.",
