Machine Learning Foundations for Product Managers,"In this first course of the AI Product Management Specialization offered by Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, you will build a foundational understanding of what machine learning is, how it works and when and why it is applied.  To successfully manage an AI team or product and work collaboratively with data scientists, software engineers, and customers you need to understand the basics of machine learning technology.  This course provides a non-coding introduction to machine learning, with focus on the process of developing models, ML model evaluation and interpretation, and the intuition behind common ML and deep learning algorithms.  The course will conclude with a hands-on project in which you will have a chance to train and optimize a machine learning model on a simple real-world problem.",Data Science,Machine Learning,Course,"Data Science,Artificial Neural Network,Machine Learning,Predictive Analytics,Modeling,"
