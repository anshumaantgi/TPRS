        "Short Intro": "In a 2014 study of CEOs and CMOs, IBM found 63% wanted social strategies which generate business metrics while only 20% of businesses worldwide actually have them. This means strategies which not only grow your company\u2019s social footprint but link to your sales and marketing systems. With this critical linkage, your social and mobile strategies will provide you with the ability to engage consumers at a 1-to-1 level and measure your social investments in terms of costs, revenues, profits and ROI. In this fifth MOOC of the Social Marketing Specialization - \"The Business of Social\" - you will learn how to transform your organization's social marketing from an untracked investment to an integral part of your company\u2019s marketing strategy. You will learn the legal considerations involved as well as proven performance metrics and management tactics for success.",
