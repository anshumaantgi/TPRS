Our village health worker training course reviews the process of training and continuing education of CHWs as an important component of involving communities in their own health service delivery.

The course draws on real-life examples from community-directed onchocerciasis control, village health worker programs, community case management efforts, peer educators programs and patent medicine vendor training programs, to name a few.",
