        "URL": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2",
        "Short Intro": "This is a survey of modern history from a global perspective.  Part Two begins early in the twentieth century, as older ways of doing things and habits of thought give way.  What follows is an era of cataclysmic struggles over what ideas and institutions will take their place.  The course concludes in the present day, as communities everywhere are transitioning into a new era of world history.  Again we work hard to grasp what is happening and ask:  Why?  Again we are drawn to pivotal choices made at key moments by individuals and communities.",
