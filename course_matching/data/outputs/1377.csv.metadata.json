        "Short Intro": "In this course, learners will complete several VBA projects.  It is highly recommended that learners first take \"Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 1\" and \"Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 2\".  This course builds off of skills learned in those two courses.  This is a project-based course.  Therefore, the projects are quite open-ended and there are multiple ways to solve the problems.  Through the use of Peer Review, other learners will grade learners' projects based on a grading rubric.",
