        "Short Intro": "While most specializations on Coursera conclude with a project-based course, students in the \"Fundamentals of Computing\" specialization have completed more than 20+ projects during the first six courses of the specialization. Given that much of the material in these courses is reused from session to session, our goal in this capstone class is to provide a conclusion to the specialization that allows each student an opportunity to demonstrate their individual mastery of the material in the specialization.",
