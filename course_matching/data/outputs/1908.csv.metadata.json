        "Short Intro": "In this course, you\u2019ll learn how serious and life-threatening illnesses often affect emotional and spiritual well-being. Illnesses can increase stress as patients and families learn to live with a \u201cnew normal\u201d that may often focus on illness. You\u2019ll learn how to tell when normal sadness (or grief) becomes something more serious and needs to be addressed. People with serious illnesses also have social concerns as their family, friends and community support system becomes stretched, and sometimes fails. We\u2019ll talk about resources and skills you can use to help support patients and families. You\u2019ll learn about advance care planning, that includes shared decision-making, setting goals of care, and writing down plans for care.",
