        "Short Intro": "Have you ever made a conscious effort to change the way you eat (for health or other reasons) and then felt frustrated when your plans were derailed? You\u2019re not alone. The best laid plans are often sabotaged by a food environment that makes it increasingly hard to make healthier food choices. This can leave many people feeling mistrustful of food or feeling that our relationship with food is somehow broken. In this course, we\u2019ll explore the history of our changing food environment, the science behind cravings for unhealthy foods AND most importantly, you\u2019ll learn some concrete strategies for rebuilding your relationship with food. You\u2019ll learn to practice mindful eating and self-compassion (proven strategies for supporting healthier food choices) as well as designing a customized plan to protect your relationship with food and improve the health of your greatest asset - you! I can\u2019t wait to start on this adventure together.",
