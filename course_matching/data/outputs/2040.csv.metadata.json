        "Short Intro": "Useful quantitative models help you to make informed decisions both in situations in which the factors affecting your decision are clear, as well as in situations in which some important factors are not clear at all. In this course, you can learn how to create quantitative models to reflect complex realities, and how to include in your model elements of risk and uncertainty. You\u2019ll also learn the methods for creating predictive models for identifying optimal choices; and how those choices change in response to changes in the model\u2019s assumptions. You\u2019ll also learn the basics of the measurement and management of risk. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to build your own models with your own data, so that you can begin making data-informed decisions. You\u2019ll also be prepared for the next course in the Specialization.",
