3-Axis Machining with Autodesk Fusion 360,"As our machining geometry gets more complicated, Autodesk® Fusion 360™ is up to the task!  With a host of standard and adaptive toolpaths we can rapidly remove material from even the most complicated 3d parts. In this course, we explore how to rough and finish geometry that requires tool motion in X, Y, and Z simultaneously, learning how to finish even the finest of details. We’ll wrap up this course by creating a full CNC program for a part, simulating it, and exporting it to G-code.",Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Course,"Manufacturing Process Management,Computer-Aided Design (CAD),Computer-Aided Manufacturing,Autodesk Fusion 360,Mechanical Engineering,"
