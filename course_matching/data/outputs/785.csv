Computational Thinking for Problem Solving,"Computational thinking is the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a solution such that it can be carried out by a computer.  But you don't need to be a computer scientist to think like a computer scientist!  In fact, we encourage students from any field of study to take this course.  Many quantitative and data-centric problems can be solved using computational thinking and an understanding of computational thinking will give you a foundation for solving problems that have real-world, social impact.
