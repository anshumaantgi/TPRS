The first module is designed to understand the Black-Scholes model and utilize it to derive Greeks, which measures the sensitivity of option value to variables such as underlying asset price, volatility, and time to maturity. Greeks are important in risk management and hedging and often used to measure portfolio value change. Then we will analyze risk management of derivatives portfolios from two perspectives\u2014Greeks approach and scenario analysis. The second module reveals how option\u2019s theoretical price links to real market price\u2014by implied volatility. We will discuss pricing by volatility surface as well as explanations of volatility smile and skew, which are common in real markets.
