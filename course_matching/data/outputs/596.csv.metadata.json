        "Short Intro": "We currently face unprecedented challenges on a global scale. These problems do not neatly fall into disciplines. They are complicated, complex, and connected. Join us on this epic journey of 13.8 billion years starting at the Big Bang and travelling through time all the way to the future. Discover the connections in our world, the power of collective learning, how our universe and our world has evolved from incredible simplicity to ever-increasing complexity. Experience our modern scientific origin story through Big History and discover the important links between past, current, and future events. You will find two different types of lectures. \u2018Zooming In\u2019 lectures from multiple specialists enable you to understand key concepts through the lens of different disciplines, whilst David Christian's \u2018Big History Framework\u2019 lectures provide the connective overview for a journey through eight thresholds of Big History.",
