Introduction to Quantum Information,"The course provides an introduction to quantum information at a beginning graduate level. It focuses on the fundamental understanding of how information is processed with quantum systems and how the quantum properties apply to computing and communication tasks. The course begins by presenting quantum theory as the framework of information processing. Quantum systems are introduced with single and two qubits. Axioms of quantum theory such as states, dynamics, and measurements are explained as preparation, evolution, and readout of qubits. Quantum computing and quantum communication are explained. Entanglement is identified as a key resource of quantum information processing. Manipulation and quantification of entangled states are provided. ",Math and Logic,Math and Logic,Course,
