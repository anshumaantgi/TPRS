With the advice of your peer readers, you will revise, rewrite, and complete it. The skills you\u2019ve learned of plotting, setting, physical description, characterization, and stylistic clarity and innovation will culminate in an original work of art all your own.  We\u2019ll discuss the steps that professional writers take to bring their work into the public world.  Along the way you\u2019ll learn the patient habits of revision that make up the writer\u2019s life.",
