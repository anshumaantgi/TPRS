        "Short Intro": "The third course in the specialization Introduction to Programming in C introduces the programming constructs pointers, arrays, and recursion. Pointers provide control and flexibility when programming in C by giving you a way to refer to the location of other data. Arrays provide a way to bundle data by guaranteeing sequences of data are grouped together. Finally, recursive functions\u2014functions that call themselves\u2014provide an alternative to iteration that are very useful for implementing certain algorithms.",
