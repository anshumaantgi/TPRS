        "Short Intro": "You\u2019ve hit a major milestone as a computer scientist and are becoming a capable programmer. You now know how to solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze solutions; and you have a wealth of tools (like data structures) at your disposal.  You may now be ready for an internship or (possibly) an entry-level software engineering job.  But can you land the internship/job?  It depends in part on how well you can solve new technical problems and communicate during interviews.  How can you get better at this?  Practice!  ",
