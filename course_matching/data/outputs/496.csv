What’s important from a business perspective is to align and adapt to such digital disruptions. In today’s competitive business market, the key to success is wise data-driven decisions, made based on reliable information. As part of your work responsibilities, you would have discovered, synthesized, and analyzed information collected from various sources at some point in time. This is Business Analysis. It is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to enterprise business problems.
