Multi-Axis CNC Toolpaths,"Computer Numerical Controlled machines, or CNC for short, can have a nearly endless number of options. Most machines today control tool motion in 3-axes, X, Y and Z, but can be upgraded to include a 4th or 5th axis as well, A and B. Additionally, there are many machines on the market that are already 5-axis capable. The good news is that Autodesk® Fusion 360™ has you covered if you need to control multi-axis positioning or simultaneous motion in all 5 axes at once!",Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Course,"Computer-aided manufaturing,Engineering,Manufacturing process,Autodesk Fusion 360,Mechanical Engineering,"
