In this course, we will look at the root cause of obesity, as explained by the latest science. We will see how our food environment has evolved over the last half-century, and how it is altering our biology to over-consume calories and resist sustained weight loss.

By developing a better understanding of the physiology behind obesity, you will learn how to work with your body to prevent and manage weight gain.
