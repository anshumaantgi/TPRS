Functional Program Design in Scala,"In this course you will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger Scala applications. You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. Youâ€™ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world. Finally, you will learn how to leverage the ability of the compiler to infer values from types.",Computer Science,Software Development,Course,"Laziness,Type Class,Functional Programming,Referential Transparency,Reactive Programming,"
