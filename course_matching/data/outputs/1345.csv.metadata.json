        "Short Intro": "How do we infer which genes orchestrate various processes in the cell?  How did humans migrate out of Africa and spread around the world? In this class, we will see that these two seemingly different questions can be addressed using similar algorithmic and machine learning techniques arising from the general problem of dividing data points into distinct clusters.",
