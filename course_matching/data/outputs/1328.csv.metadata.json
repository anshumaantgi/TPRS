        "Short Intro": "Ecology is all about connections. In this course, we\u2019ll see how interdependent every living thing is and how people are impacting the natural world. Like all sciences, ecology isn\u2019t just a list of known facts\u2013 it\u2019s also a process. I love telling stories, and I\u2019ve included many stories about how we\u2019ve come to know what we know about ecology through observations and experiments.",
