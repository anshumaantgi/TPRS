Reinforcement Learning for Trading Strategies,"In the final course from the Machine Learning for Trading specialization, you will be introduced to reinforcement learning (RL) and the benefits of using reinforcement learning in trading strategies. You will learn how RL has been integrated with neural networks and review LSTMs and how they can be applied to time series data. By the end of the course, you will be able to build trading strategies using reinforcement learning, differentiate between actor-based policies and value-based policies, and incorporate RL into a momentum trading strategy.",Data Science,Machine Learning,Course,"Reinforcement Learning Model Development,Reinforcement Learning Trading Algorithm Optimization,Reinforcement Learning Trading Strategy Development,Reinforcement Learning Trading Algo Development,"
