        "Short Intro": "Welcome to Course THREE!  In the first two Modules you will gain a more professional-level understanding of the Design Elements that artists have used throughout history to create successful compositions.  Arranging the Elements in ways that lead viewers through their compositions is an essential craft for photographers no matter whether their subject matter is pure documentary or vividly exotic personal expression.  In Modules 3 & 4 we survey the essential elements of post-photography image management, using Adobe(tm) LIGHTROOM(tm).  Image adjustment software designed for Smartphone photographers rounds out the Course.  Since even photographers whose mainstay is a high-end DSLR also must admit to Smartphone use occasionally, and photographers who only use a Smartphone will usually admit that they want to step over to a \"regular\" camera at some point, there is something for everyone here!  Let's get started with Module One!",
