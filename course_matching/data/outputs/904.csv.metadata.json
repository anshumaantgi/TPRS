        "Short Intro": "By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to manipulate files and processes on your computer\u2019s operating system. You\u2019ll also have learned about regular expressions -- a very powerful tool for processing text files -- and you\u2019ll get practice using the Linux command line on a virtual machine. And, this might feel like a stretch right now, but you\u2019ll also write a program that processes a bunch of errors in an actual log file and then generates a summary file. That\u2019s a super useful skill for IT Specialists to know.",
