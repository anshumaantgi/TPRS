Teach English Now! Foundational Principles,"Through a series of engaging metaphors and stories, prospective and current EFL/ESL teachers will identify, summarize, and evaluate 7 basic language learning paradigms.  Learners will be presented information on such foundational principles as motivation, risk taking, two different modes of learning, and balancing the teacher profession.  Learners are also given an understanding of basic techniques founded on those principles, such as teacher talk, looking “ridiculous” in order to lower the affective filter, and networking.
