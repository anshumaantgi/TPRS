        "URL": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-capstone?specialization=nonprofit",
        "Short Intro": "The Capstone Project is a service learning experience designed to apply the knowledge and skills developed in the three Specialization courses  to a real world leadership and governance situation. It is also intended to develop the participant's capability to act as an agent for positive change in nonprofit organizations. To this end, you will analyze the leadership and governance effectiveness of a real board of directors in an organization of your own choosing (or, if that is not possible, data gathered from a real board provided by the course instructors). By the end of the Capstone Project, you will have produced a professional consulting report detailing your analysis and recommendations to improve board leadership and governance effectiveness. You will then present it to the board and advise them on implementing change.",
