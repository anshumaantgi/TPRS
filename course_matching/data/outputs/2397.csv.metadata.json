        "Short Intro": "Many beginning guitarists have learned the basics of open and movable chord shapes, but want to further expand this chord knowledge. In this course you\u2019ll learn how to construct and play triads and basic 7th chords. You\u2019ll start by creating major and minor triad inversions, and move on to power chords, drop-2 voicings, and learn how to substitute common chords to create a richer harmonic experience for listeners. Throughout the course, you will focus on the notes that chords are made up of, rather than the shape of individual chords. With this knowledge, you will be able to create inversions and different chord voicings up and down, and across the entire fretboard of the guitar, thus unlocking new ways of playing the guitar.",
