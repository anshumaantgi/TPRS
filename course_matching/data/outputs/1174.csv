Project Management Project,"This capstone project is designed to allow you to take the knowledge you have gained through the Specialization and put that knowledge into practice. In the capstone, you will create several of the key planning deliverables that have been discussed in these courses and either work on a project you choose or use a suggested case study. You will begin the capstone project by writing part of the project charter. You will build on that information to define your project, and then ultimately create a schedule, budget and responses for the risks you identify.  The goal is for you to use what you have learned in the previous courses and to perform your own research on how to best move forward with the capstone project.  Your work will be peer reviewed by your classmates. In turn you will peer review the work of other classmates.  Instructions on how to conduct peer reviews will be included in the course.  Upon completing this series, you will be able to (1) write a narrative charter statement, (2) create a work breakdown structure, (3) sequence project activities,(4) build a project schedule, (5) create a project budget, (6) create a responsibility assignment matrix, (7) identify project risks and (8) define responses for those risks.",Business,Business Essentials,Course,"Schedule,Project Management,Risk Management,Budget,"
