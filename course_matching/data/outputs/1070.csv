Simple Regression Analysis in Public Health ,"Biostatistics is the application of statistical reasoning to the life sciences, and it's the key to unlocking the data gathered by researchers and the evidence presented in the scientific public health literature. In this course, we'll focus on the use of simple regression methods to determine the relationship between an outcome of interest and a single predictor via a linear equation. Along the way, you'll be introduced to a variety of methods, and you'll practice interpreting data and performing calculations on real data from published studies.  Topics include logistic regression, confidence intervals, p-values, Cox regression, confounding, adjustment, and effect modification.",Health,Public Health,Course,"P-Value,Proportional Hazards Model,Confounding,regression,"
