        "Short Intro": "The course provides an introduction to quantum information at a beginning graduate level. It focuses on the fundamental understanding of\u00a0how information is processed with quantum systems and how the quantum\u00a0properties\u00a0apply to computing and communication tasks. The course begins by presenting quantum theory as the framework of information processing. Quantum systems\u00a0are introduced with single and two qubits. Axioms of quantum theory such as states, dynamics, and measurements are explained as preparation, evolution, and readout of qubits.\u00a0Quantum computing and quantum communication are explained. Entanglement is identified as a key resource of quantum\u00a0information processing. Manipulation and quantification of entangled\u00a0states are provided.\u00a0",
