        "Short Intro": "In this fourth and final course of the specialization, you will synthesize your learning into a project deliverable called a Blockchain Opportunity Analysis.  The goals of this course are twofold: One, it\u2019s for you to identify a specific need or problem in Global Commerce that can potentially be solved using blockchain technology. Two, it\u2019s for you to investigate possible solutions to this problem, including how these solutions might be executed. You will accomplish different project milestones each week, and will be introduced to several tools that entrepreneurs use to organize their findings. Throughout this process, you will hear from real-world practitioners who have hands-on experience in the blockchain ecosystem.  Additionally, by participating in this course you will gain access to our Blockchain Case Commons\u2014a crowdsourced collection of blockchain applications and use-cases spanning multiple industries.  As an outcome of this course, you\u2019ll walk away with a consolidated, peer-reviewed Blockchain Opportunity Analysis, which you can use to pitch your idea to your organization or even to potential investors.",
