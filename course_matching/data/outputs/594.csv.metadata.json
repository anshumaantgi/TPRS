        "Short Intro": "Affordable, abundant and reliable energy is fundamental to human well-being and prosperity. For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels \u2013 coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important \u2013 and sometimes conflicting \u2013 drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earth\u2019s environments.
