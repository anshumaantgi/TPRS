To think strategically, you need to analyze insights and evaluate possible scenarios before building that strategy. It\u2019s possible to eliminate some uncertainties and identify trends, but you need the right process. You\u2019ll have to gain insights first, and then take a long look at what you have. With all the right information, you can start to make informed decisions about your next steps.",
