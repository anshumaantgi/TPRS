Introduction to Genetics and Evolution,"Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at Duke University. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology.  We often hear about new ""genome sequences,"" commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found ""genetic evidence for natural selection.""  This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology (and especially evolutionary genetics).  No prior coursework is assumed.",Health,Basic Science,Course,"Biology,Genetics,Evolution,Genomics,"
