        "Short Intro": "Our immune system is a powerful network. It protects us from external threats, such as harmful substances and pathogenic agents, as well as cellular changes which could lead to diseases. Complications emerge when our natural defences do not function properly, which can result in immune disorders. These can take the form of less severe issues such as insect allergy. Others are more harmful, such as auto aggressive immune reactions, that lead to localised or systemic tissue damage.  ",
