        "Short Intro": "Showcase your skills in Data Engineering with this Python Project! This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to collect and work with data. You will assume the role of a Data Engineer and extract data from multiple file formats, transform it into specific datatypes, and then load it into a single source for analysis. Continue with the course and test your knowledge by implementing webscraping and extracting data with APIs all with the help of multiple hands-on labs.  ",
