Story and Narrative Development for Video Games,"In this course, you will examine how storytelling acts as a vital mechanism for driving video gameplay forward. Looking at several historical and contemporary games, you will be asked to evaluate and interpret different story styles with the goal of identifying themes and procedures for your own game ideas. We'll examine traditional narrative story processes, such as three-act structure, and how they fit into game story flows and the strategic elements of gameplay.  Ultimately, you will learn how to define character, setting, and structure to create a compelling game concept.",Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Course,"Interactive Storytelling,Video Game Development,Video Game Design,Game Design,"
