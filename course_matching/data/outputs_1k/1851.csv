"GIS, Mapping, and Spatial Analysis Capstone","In this capstone course, you will apply everything you have learned by designing and then completing your own GIS project. You will plan out your project by writing a brief proposal that explains what you plan to do and why. You will then find data for a topic and location of your choice, and perform analysis and create maps that allow you to try out different tools and data sets. The results of your work will be assembled into an Esri story map, which is a web site with maps, images, text, and video. The goal is for you to have a finished product that you can share, and that demonstrates what you have learned.",Physical Science and Engineering,Environmental Science and Sustainability,Course,"Geographic Information System (GIS),Cartography,Esri,Mapping,Spatial Analysis,"
