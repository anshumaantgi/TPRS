        "Short Intro": "The Executive Data Science Capstone, the specialization\u2019s culminating project, is an opportunity for people who have completed all four EDS courses to apply what they've learned to a real-world scenario developed in collaboration with Zillow, a data-driven online real estate and rental marketplace, and DataCamp, a web-based platform for data science programming. Your task will be to lead a virtual data science team and make key decisions along the way to demonstrate that you have what it takes to shepherd a complex analysis project from start to finish.  For the final project, you will prepare and submit a presentation, which will be evaluated and graded by your fellow capstone participants.",
