Modeling and Design for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360,"There are many considerations that play a part in engineering a new product. Regardless of what that product is, there are fundamentals such as form, fit, and function when it comes to digital modeling. In this course, we lay the foundation to create any design and dive deep into topics about the control of the design. From assembly joints and joint limits to complex shapes using forms, rest assured that your design will be rock solid.",Physical Science and Engineering,Mechanical Engineering,Course,"Autodesk,Computer-Aided Design (CAD),Fusion 360,Mechanical Engineering,Modeling,"
