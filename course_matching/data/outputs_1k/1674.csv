Camera and Imaging,"This course covers the fundamentals of imaging â€“ the creation of an image that is ready for consumption or processing by a human or a machine. Imaging has a long history, spanning several centuries. But the advances made in the last three decades have revolutionized the camera and dramatically improved the robustness and accuracy of computer vision systems. We describe the fundamentals of imaging, as well as recent innovations in imaging that have had a profound impact on computer vision.",Computer Science,Algorithms,Course,"Fourier Transform,High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) Imaging,Image Formation,Convolution and Deconvolution,Working Principles of a Camera,"
