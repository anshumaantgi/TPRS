Photography Capstone Project,"The Capstone Project is your opportunity to take advantage of the knowledge you have gained through our journey in learning about photography, to develop a meaningful project of 10 well formed photographs based in your passion for artistic expression, or a subject for documentary exploration, insightful portraiture, imaging for work-related subjects, or some other aspect of photography.  We are confident that it will be a project that you will be excited to share with fellow Learners.  You should plan on spending more time on this Course per week than any other in this Specialization, and much of it will be in making photographs.",Arts and Humanities,Music and Art,Course,"Art,Project,Photography,Writing,"
