This course explores different financing models, including bootstrapping, organic growth, debt and risk capital, and also provides a clear overview of equity financing including the key types of investors: angels, venture capital, and crowdfunding. You\u2019ll learn about terms, and term sheets, exit modes and what exit strategy might be best for you. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll have an understanding of what success looks like and how it can be financed. You\u2019ll also be ready for the capstone project, in which you will get feedback on your own pitch deck, and may even be selected to pitch to investors from venture capital firms.",
