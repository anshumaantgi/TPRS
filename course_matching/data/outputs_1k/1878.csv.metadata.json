        "Short Intro": "Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome and gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other technologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources \u2013 mainly web-based programs and databases \u2013 to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on.
