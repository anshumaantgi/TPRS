We will explore the brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory, learning, attention, perception and consciousness.  We will examine human development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will discuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts and behavior.  Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness and the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them.   ",
