        "Short Intro": "As our machining geometry gets more complicated, Autodesk\u00ae Fusion 360\u2122 is up to the task!  With a host of standard and adaptive toolpaths we can rapidly remove material from even the most complicated 3d parts. In this course, we explore how to rough and finish geometry that requires tool motion in X, Y, and Z simultaneously, learning how to finish even the finest of details. We\u2019ll wrap up this course by creating a full CNC program for a part, simulating it, and exporting it to G-code.",
