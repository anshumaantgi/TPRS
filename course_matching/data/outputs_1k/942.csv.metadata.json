        "Title": "Understanding Plants - Part I: What a Plant Knows",
        "URL": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/plantknows",
        "Short Intro": "For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form\u2014from Charles Darwin\u2019s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn\u2019s distorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world\u2014from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We\u2019ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you\u2019ve been playing for them or if they\u2019re just deaf to the sounds around them. We\u2019ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature. ",
