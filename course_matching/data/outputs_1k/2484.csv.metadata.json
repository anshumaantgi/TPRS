        "Short Intro": "In Uncommon Sense Teaching: TEACHING ONLINE we\u2019d like to help you to move toward fresh approaches to online teaching that build on the latest insights from scientific research. We\u2019ll use insights from movie-making\u2014not to mention from odd visual tricks in Barb\u2019s kitchen\u2014to see how students learn, both independently and together. We all know, for example, that social learning is valuable in helping students grapple with tough concepts as well as in making learning more fun. But if you understand what is happening in the brain during social learning, you can also understand why certain approaches commonly used in online learning, such as discussion forums, can sometimes pose a challenge.  As you will see, we can use insights from neuroscience not only to motivate our students, but to help them change their very identity.  ",
