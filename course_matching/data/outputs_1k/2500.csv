An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1),"This two-part course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications. Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.",Computer Science,Software Development,Course,"Programming Principles,Python Syntax And Semantics,Computer Programming,Python Programming,"
