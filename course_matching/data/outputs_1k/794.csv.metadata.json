        "Short Intro": "If you\u2019ve ever skipped over`the results section of a medical paper because terms like \u201cconfidence interval\u201d or \u201cp-value\u201d go over your head, then you\u2019re in the right place. You may be a clinical practitioner reading research articles to keep up-to-date with developments in your field or a medical student wondering how to approach your own research. Greater confidence in understanding statistical analysis and the results can benefit both working professionals and those undertaking research themselves. ",
