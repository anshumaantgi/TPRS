        "Short Intro": "CNC machines come in an almost endless array of configurations for various applications. So far, we have only talked about CNC Mills. More specifically vertical milling centers. In this course we turn our attention to the CNC Lathe. We identify the difference in a lathe\u2019s coordinate system, tools, and how to create lathe specific toolpaths.",
